📊 Stock Information Dashboard
This project is a responsive Stock Information Dashboard built using Next.js (for performance and routing), TypeScript (for type safety), and Tailwind CSS (for styling).

The dashboard fulfills the mandatory requirements of displaying key data for at least five NIFTY 50 stocks, including the Company Name, Symbol, Current Price, Percentage Change, and Volume.

Key Features Demonstrated:
Dashboard View: Presents stock data in a clear, accessible table format.

Search Functionality: Allows users to efficiently filter stocks by Company Name or Stock Symbol using React's useState and useEffect hooks.

Stock Details Page: Implements dynamic Next.js routing (/stocks/[symbol]) to display detailed information for a selected stock (including Day High/Low, 52 Week High/Low, and Market Cap), fetched from mock JSON data.

React Concepts: Proficiently uses useState, useEffect, Props, and Reusable Components (SearchBar, StockTable).

SEO Optimization (Bonus): Leverages Next.js Server Components and the Metadata API to implement Dynamic Titles, OpenGraph (OG) tags, and JSON-LD structured data, ensuring high Lighthouse SEO scores and robust sharing capabilities.
